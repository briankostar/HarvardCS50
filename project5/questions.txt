0.  How many different colors does each format support? (BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG)
    BMP - depends, but up to 32 bit color, or over 240 trillion.
    GIF - up to 8-bit color, or 256 colors.
    JPEG - up to 24 bit, or 16.8 million colors.
    PNG - 24 bit RGB or 32 bit with RGBA
    
1.  Which of these formats supports animation?
    Only GIF supports animation.

2.  s the difference between lossy and lossless compression?
    Lossless compression makes image smaller, but with no negative effect to quality and can be reversed.
    Lossy means image is smaller, usually more than lossless compression, but with cost to the quality.
    Saving in lossy format will make image progressively worse and worse.

3.  Which of these formats is lossy-compressed?
    JPEG is lossy as it was designed to make images as small as possible in the way humans wont notice.

4.  What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT file system?
    FAT, or File Allocation Table store linked list of disk clusters that DOS uses to mange space on RAM.
    16/32 refers to the sector number's bi length. Hard dries are addressed in 512byte sectors.
    FAT system groups these into clusters. 
    When FAT file is deleted, 1. filename is modified to signal file has been deleted.
    2. Occupied FAT cluster are listed as free clusters
    However, the actual file data is not touched and could still be recovered.

5.  What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files you delete cannot be recovered?
    1. Physically destroy the drive.
    2. Degauss the drive's magnetic components
    3. Overwite drive's data which destorys original data.
    
6.  s stdint.h?
    A header file that declare sets of integer types with specified widths(# of bits used to store its value in binary)
    
7.  s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
    These are exact-width integer types. 
    Using these makes it clear to the program that you intend to use the data in a specific way.
    uint8_t: typedef unsigned char
    uint32_t: typedef unsigned long int
    int32_t: typedef signed long int
    uint16_t: typedef unsigned int

8.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively? (Assume a 32-bit architecture like the CS50 Appliance.)
    BYTE is 1 byte or 8 bit
    DWORD is 4 bytes or 32 bit
    LONG is 4 bytes or 32 bit
    WORD is 2 bytes or 16 bit

9.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? 
    (Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers.)"
    First 2 bytes of any BMP should be a WORD of bfType and set to BM 0x4D42.


10. s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
    bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the BMP file
    biSize is size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure in bytes.
    bonus:
    biSizeImage - total size of img in bytes - inlcude pixels and padding
    biWidth - width of img in pixels, not include padding
    biHeight - height of img in pixel

11. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
    Positive biHeight means bitmap is bottom-up Device Independent Bitmap, and origin is lower-left corner.
    If negative, bitmap is top-down DIB and origin is upper-left corner.

12. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
    The biBitCount of BITMAPINFOHEADER determines the number of bits that define each pixel and thus max # of colors in BMP.

13. Why might fopen return NULL in copy.c:37?
    NULL will be returned if file is not accessible. No authority, not readable, or no space to read-to.

14. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
    fread( void *buffer, size_t size, size_t num, FILE *stream ), reads # of objects(size in bytes) and place them into the array pointed to by buffer.
    The third argument, size_t num is 1 because we're reading 1 RGB triple at a time.

15. What value does copy.c:70 assign padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
    1

16. What does fseek do?
    Move to specific location of a file. 
    fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int origin) sets the file position data for the given stream. Return 0 on success, non-zero on faile.

17. What is SEEK_CUR?
    Argument, one of 3 origin values, that tells seek() to seek from the current location.

18. Whodunit?
    Milo Banana dun it.
